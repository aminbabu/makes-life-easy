## Overview

### How to use

- Clone or Download the repository. In the folder `developers-alarm/alarm-clock` you will see all the progam files.

- By default alarm time and rest time are set to 25 and 5 minutes respectively. But you can change as per your needs. To change the alarm time you should modify the variables named `workTime` and `restTime` in the `app.js` file as follows:

```js
const workTime = 25; // Set work time (minute)
const restTime = 5; // Set rest time (minute)
```

- To run the alarm app:
  1. Go to the `developers-alarm/alarm-clock` folder
  2. Press `shift` and `mouse left button` together
  3. Then select `cmd` or any terminal
  4. Type `node ./app.js` and hit enter.
  5. Minimise the terminal and wait for the next alarm to take rest and call for back to work.

```
node ./app.js
```

> This process will run till manual termination.

### Dependency

NodeJs should be installed in your machine.
```
